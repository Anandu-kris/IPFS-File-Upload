# IPFS-File-Upload
</br>
This project provides an overview of the Node.js code for uploading files to IPFS using the Moralis API. This code allows you to leverage the Moralis API, a powerful blockchain development platform, to upload files to IPFS, a decentralized and distributed file system.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- Moralis API credentials (API key, API secret)

## Getting Started

- Clone or download the repository.
- Install the required dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
- Open the uploadFile.js file and enter your Moralis API credentials in the designated placeholders.
- Customize the code as per your requirements. You can modify the file path, additional metadata, or add any other desired functionality.
- Run the script by executing node uploadFile.js. This will initiate the file upload process to IPFS using the Moralis API.
- After the upload is completed, the script will output the IPFS hash of the uploaded file. The IPFS hash uniquely identifies the file on the IPFS network.

## Additional Information

- The uploadFile.js script utilizes the Moralis API's file.upload method to handle the file upload process. You can find more information about the Moralis API and its usage in the [Moralis API documentation](https://docs.moralis.io/).
- Ensure that your Moralis API credentials are valid and properly configured in the code to establish a successful connection.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code to fit your specific requirements. You can extend it to handle multiple files, implement error handling, or integrate it into your existing Node.js projects.
